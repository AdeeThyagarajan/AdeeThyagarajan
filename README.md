## Hi, I’m Adhith 👋  
Product focused Data and AI Engineer

I work at the intersection of data, product, and applied AI. I design systems that help people think clearly, make better decisions, and actually use what we build.

I have over seven years of experience across aviation, retail, fintech, energy, and digital media, and I build personal AI projects that explore behaviour, reasoning, and constraint driven design.
